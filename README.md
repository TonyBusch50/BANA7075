# BANA7075 Final Project
GUI to operate multiple data scrapers and merge the data for ingestion.

Hamilton_Co_DLer - This script downloads a csv file from Hamilton Co. Auditor of the current Months sales.  It timestamps the file with the date/time it was downloaded. The key item used from this csv is the parcel ID used as a reference to pull additional data.  Update the save directory to align with other scripts.
